        "origin": "A synthetic carbohydrate alcohol, produced from milk sugar (lactose) derived from whey (milk).",
        "characteristics": "Low-calorie sweetener.",
        "products": "Many bakery and confectionery products.",
        "daily_intake": "Not defined.",
        "side_effects": "Lactitol is partly absorbed and metabolised as glucose by the body; the remaining fraction is fermented in the large intestine. During fermentation, gases are produced, which may cause bloating and flatulence. In intolerant persons it can act as a laxative. Side effects normally occur after an intake of 25-30 grams in a single dose, which is far above the usage in normal foods.",
        "dietary_restrictions": "Lactitol can be used by all religious groups and vegetarians, but not by vegans, as the source is milk sugar. The term carbohydrate alcohol is a chemical definition; lactitol does not contain alcohol (ethanol)."
