        "origin": "  Esters of sugar and synthetic fats, produced from glycerol and natural fatty acids. The fatty acids are mainly from plant origin, but also fats of animal origin may be used. The product generally is a mixture of different components, with a composition similar to partially digested natural fat esterified with sugar.",

        "side_effects": "None known. The products are first digested to sugar and fats. The body metabolises all components identical to sugar and natural fat. The individual components of the mono- and diglycerides are also produced normally in the body when digesting normal fat.",
        "dietary_restrictions": "Although mainly vegetable oils are used, the use of animal fat (incl. pork) can not be excluded. Several groups, such as vegans, Muslims and Jews thus avoid these products. Only the producer can give detailed information on the origin of the fatty acids. Chemically the fatty acids from vegetable or animal origin are identical."
