        "origin": "  Combination of propanediol and natural fats. Normal fat consists of glycerol and fatty acids, for these products glycerol is replaced by propanediol. The fats are mainly from plant origin, but also fats of animal origin may be used. The product generally is a mixture of different components.",
        "characteristics": "Emulsifiers and stabilisers.",
        "products": "Bakery products",
        "daily_intake": "Up to 25 mg/kg bodyweight for propyleneglycol",
        "side_effects": "Both components are normally present in the body and will be metabolised in the normal way. High concentrations of propyleneglycol can cause eczema in sensitive persons, but not normally from the use in foods.",
        "dietary_restrictions": "Although mainly vegetable oils are used, the use of animal fat (incl. pork) can not be excluded.
