        "origin": "Synthetic azo dye. See  for a background on azo dyes.",
        "characteristics": "Black food colour. Very soluble in water.",
        "products": "Restricted use, but in large product range.",
        "daily_intake": "Up to 1-5 mg/kg body weight.",
        "side_effects": "Since it is an azo dye, it may elicit intolerance in people intolerant to salicylates. Additionally, it is a histamine liberator, and may intensify symptoms of asthma. In combination with benzoates, it is also implicated in hyperactivity in children. In the intestines, it can be transformed by bacteria into possibly hazardous compounds, hence the rather low ADI and restricted use.",
        "dietary_restrictions": "None; E151 can be consumed by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians."
