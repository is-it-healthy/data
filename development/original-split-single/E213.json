        "origin": "Benzoic acid, benzoates and benzoic acid esters are commonly found in most fruits, especially berries. Cranberries are a very rich source of benzoic acid. In addition to fruits, benzoates occur naturally in mushrooms, cinnamon, cloves and some dairy products (as a result of bacterial fermentation). For commercial purposes, it is prepared chemically from toluene.",
        "characteristics": "Benzoic acid and benzoates are used as preservatives against both yeasts and bacteria in acidic products. They are not very effective against fungi, and ineffective in products with a pH above 5 (slightly acidic or neutral). High concentrations lead to a sour taste, which limits the application. Benzoates are often preferred, due to better solubility.",
        "products": "Benzoic acid and benzoates are used in a wide range of acid or slightly acidic products.",
        "daily_intake": "Up to 5 mg/kg body weight.",
        "side_effects": "No side effects in the concentrations used. In some people benzoic acid and benzoates may liberate histamine and thus cause pseudo-allergic reactions.",
        "dietary_restrictions": " benzoic acid and benzoates can be consumed by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians."
