        "side_effects": "Few side effects in the concentrations used in foods. Increased hyperactivity has been reported in a few cases, as well as a possible connection with mutagenicity. Erythrosine causes an increased photosensitivity in people with sensitivity to sunlight. In high concentrations erythrosine interferes with iodine metabolism. However, these concentrations cannot be reached through the consumption of food.",
