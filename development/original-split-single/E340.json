        "origin": "Potassium salts of phosphoric acid. Normal constituent of the body. Commercially produced from phosphoric acid, which is produced from phosphate mined in the US.",
        "characteristics": "Potassium phosphate is an acidity regulator and chelating agent (used to bind metal ions). It prevents desiccation and is used as an acid stabiliser in powders as well as to prevent formation of clumps. It increases the activity of antioxidants.",
        "products": "Many different products.",
