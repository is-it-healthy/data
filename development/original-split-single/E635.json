    "more_info": {
        "origin": "Mixture of sodium salts of guanylic (E626) and inosinic acid (E630)",
        "characteristics": "Flavour enhancer. Guanylates and inosinates do not have the specific umami taste but strongly enhance many other flavours, thereby reducing the amounts of salt or other flavour enhancers needed in a product.",
        "products": "Used in many products. Mainly used in low sodium/salt products.",
        "daily_intake": "None determined. Guanylates and inosinates may not be used in products intended for children under 12 weeks.",
        "side_effects": "Asthmatic people should avoid guanylates and inosinates. As guanylates and inosinates are metabolised to purines, they should be avoided by people suffering from gout. However, the concentrations used are generally so low that no effects are to be expected.",
        "dietary_restrictions": "Guanylates and inosinates are generally produced from meat, but partly also from fish. They are thus not suitable for vegans and vegetarians, and in most cases not suitable for Jews, Muslims and Hindus, depending on the origin of the product. Only the producer can provide information on the origin."
