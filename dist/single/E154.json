        "side_effects": "Since it is an azo dye, it may elicit intolerance in people intolerant to salicylates. Additionally, it is a histamine liberator, and may intensify symptoms of asthma. In combination with benzoates, it is also implicated in hyperactivity in children. Some of the compounds in the mixture may be mutagenic; hence the use is restricted to a few products.",
