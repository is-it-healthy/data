        "origin": "  A natural carbohydrate alcohol, present in many berries and fruits, e.g., apples, prunes, cherries and grapes. It is commercially produced from glucose (dextrose).",
        "characteristics": "Stabiliser, low-calorie sweetener, bulking agent, etc. ",
        "products": "Many bakery and confectionery products.",
        "daily_intake": "There are no limits to the intake of E420; however, its use is not allowed for infants younger than 1 year of age, as it may cause severe diarrhoea.",
        "side_effects": "Sorbitol is partly absorbed and metabolised as fructose by the body; the remaining fraction is fermented in the large intestine. During fermentation, gases are produced, which may cause bloating and flatulence. In intolerant persons it can act as a laxative. There are normally no side effects in the concentrations used; however, some intolerant persons show gas formation at an intake as low as 5 grams of sorbitol. Side effects normally occur after an intake of 25-30 grams in a single dose, which is far above the usage in normal foods.",
        "dietary_restrictions": "Sorbitol can be used by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians. The term carbohydrate alcohol is a chemical definition; sorbitol does not contain alcohol (ethanol)."
