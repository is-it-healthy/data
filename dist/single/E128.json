        "origin": "Synthetic azo dye.",
        "characteristics": "Red food colour. Very soluble in water.",
        "products": "Restricted use in confectionery and meat products.",
        "daily_intake": "Up to 0.1 mg/kg body weight.",
        "side_effects": "Since it is an azo dye, it may elicit intolerance in people intolerant to salicylates. Additionally, it is a histamine liberator, and may intensify symptoms of asthma. In combination with benzoates, it is also implicated in hyperactivity in children. Furthermore, Red 2G may well bring about anaemia and it is possibly mutagenic. Consequently, its use has been very much restricted and the ADI reduced.",
        "dietary_restrictions": "None; E128 can be consumed by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians."
